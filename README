== Welcome to the OfficeDrop Sample OAuth Application

This application is meant to be used as a  sample application for developers
interested in calling the OfficeDrop API. It contains examples of how you can
access the API using our OAuth authentication backend.

The application contains the following features:

* List documents
* Search for documents
* View document details
* Upload a new document to officedrop

The application tries to use as little gems/dependencies as possible to make
it simpler to implement with any other rails application already available.

It can also be a nice quick start guide for other languages as well, given you
know Ruby and can understand the code.
